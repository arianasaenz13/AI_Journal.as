Week 5

This week I did use AI for the project in regards to formatting the functions properly onto the github group. We had to ensure our codes were aligning and were clear to understand. 

I also used AI to assist me on debugging in the excerices for this week. I was stuck on questions 10,19, and 20. I was messing up on simple things and was not noticing where I had messed up.

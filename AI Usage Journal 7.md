Week 7

This week I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot for the Week 7 discussion post. I had chosen Option 2 which was to use AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to help test and debug. I noticed however that Github Copilot is more faster than ChatGPT. 

I also learned that the tools can only do so much, AI can still get a prompt wrong if not given enough details.

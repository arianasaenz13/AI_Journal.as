Week 2
This week I used AI to refresh on conditionals. I had forgotten how to rewrite conditionals and needed examples so i asked ChatGPT for examples. This is th link of my search: https://chatgpt.com/c/68ccbb90-ef50-8331-b90f-8a058f0a8599

I always struggle with loops which is why I asked ChatGPT to give me cleaner ways to write them. This was the link for that search: https://chatgpt.com/c/68ccbb90-ef50-8331-b90f-8a058f0a8599

Week 1

This week I used AI to assist me on the excercise by helping me understand the important terms within the question. One of the things I had to search up where Booleans because i had forgotten how they work. Python is a new language for me so ensuring i remember everything has been a struggle. Here is a link of what AI answered for me:https://chatgpt.com/c/68c776ab-9124-8323-a3b2-e18b4d685888.

I also searched up Gemini AI because the professor has mentioned it during lecture and it has a alot of the same features that Chat GPT has. 

I hope to reduce my use on AI within these concepts because this would mean that Python is starting to stick.
